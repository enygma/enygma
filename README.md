### 🔭 **I’m currently working on...**

Right now I'm working on building out a security education and training program here at GitHub. Our group, the Security Partners team, is chartered with introducing new (and maintaining current) educational content, training, and activities across the GH org, spreading the security knowledge as far as possible! 

### 🌱 **I’m currently learning...**

There's lots of things I'm learning at the moment including:

- building out effective training programs
- practicing the definition of learning and performance objectives
- building team culture

oh, and there's some development thrown in there somewhere! 😁

### 💬 **Ask me about...**
