### 🔭 **I’m currently working on...**

Just like any application security engineer these days, I'm working on creating and securing systems that are making the most optimal use of AI possible. At the moment, that journey has brought me to Shopify as an engineer in their Trust and Security Engineering organization.

### 🌱 **I’m currently learning...**

There's lots of things I'm learning at the moment including:

- securing and hardening systems and ensuring AI driven platforms don't go off the rails (as much as possible, of course)
- working on building a team culture of security

oh, and there's some development thrown in there somewhere! 😁

### 💬 **Ask me about...**
